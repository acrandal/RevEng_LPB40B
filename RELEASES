v0.0.1 - 2025.09.15

* Early Alpha - known issues
* Python scripts cleaned up to basics
* Features:
  * Connects to device properly
  * Get Info works to return raw bytes
  * Get single measurement works to return millimeters
* No additonal interfaces for other device controls
* No high speed modes or advanced packet handling
* No exposing error codes or error handling
* No fixed UART speed controls
* Only synchronous polling from device

* Known bug: Get Info sometimes returns two double frames instead of the documented single double frame
  * This leads the .get_measurement_mm() to raise an exception
  * This seems to be a problem with the device itself. It just returns four frames instead of two

* Contributors:
  * Aaron S. Crandall \<acrandal@gmail.com>
